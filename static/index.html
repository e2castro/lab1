	<p>Hello! I am currently trying to complete this Human Computer Interaction lab. I've been running into a few problems on the way(mostly failed internet connection), but none the less I am here in my terminal editing this html file in vim because I couldn't figure out how to open this in sublime text. Anyway I should probably get back to completing the rest of this lab. Seeya! </p>
